# Waypoints Challenge

This is a home assignment for recruitment candidates to [Springworks](https://www.springworks.se).

## Insurance data categorization

Peter Griffin is a customer with Risky Insurances Inc. He pays his insurance fee based on how well he can stick to the speed limits while driving.

Peter's car has reported _Waypoints_ from a trip (e.g. where it has driven). The following data is known for each _Waypoint_:

- latitude (degrees)
- longitude (degrees)
- speed (meters per second)
- speed_limit (meters per second)
- timestamp (ISO 8601 date-time)

The data for Peter's _Waypoints_ needs to be organized in these categories, to make it possible to decide his insurance fee:

- Distance Speeding, meaning the total distance that Peter has driven at a speed exceeding the speed limit
- Duration Speeding, meaning the total time that Peter has driven at a speed exceeding the speed limit
- Total Distance, meaning the total driving distance
- Total Duration, meaning the total driving time

## Solution
